    <h1>
      Internet is <em>easy</em>!
    </h1>
    <p>
      First, we need to learn some basic HTML.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Headings
    </h2>
    <p>
      Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of headings.
    </p>
    <p>This is an <strong>unordered list</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is what an <strong>ordered list</strong> looks like:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" elemenr wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong><em>This is a strong and emphasized paragraph!</em></strong></p>
